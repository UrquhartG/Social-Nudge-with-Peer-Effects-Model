# Social Nudge with Peer Effects Model

## Team:
**coworked** by [Haozhen Guo](https://github.com/UrquhartG) and [Yumo Yao](https://github.com/YYM-yym)
**Instructed** by Dr. Renyu Zhang.

## Project Abstract
In this project, we evaluate the platform-wise effect on boosting production of a social nudge sent from the follower to the creator. Given a self-generated following relationship network on the platform, we have conducted a precise calculation of the global effect. Also an approximation is developed to avoid massive calculation in practical application. 

## Project Significance
As data science students immersed in the very environment with developed technology and fragmented entertainment, We can keenly feel the impact of social media on people's lives, as exemplified by short video platforms.

Project programming language: Python.
