# Social Nudge with Peer Effects Model

A research project coworked by Haozhen Guo and Yumo Yao, under the instruction by Dr. Renyu Zhang.

The diffusion of social nudges imposes a unique challenge in estimating social nudgesâ€™ benefit of boosting production in the counterfactual scenario in which every user can send and receive nudges. We refer to this as the global effect of social nudges. In this project, we calculate the true and estimated approximate global effect of social nudges to measure the influences of a social nudge on the platform as a whole.

Project programming language: Python.
